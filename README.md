# InPrOp-Instagram-Profile-Opener
Chrome Browser extension to automatically visit provided Instagram profiles with short delay (3 seconds) between entries (created with the help of ChatGPT).

Profiles need to be provided as either a link to an instagram profile or as the unique username into a text field with newlines between each entry. Sometimes the first entry is skipped and needs to be redone.

## Development with ChatGPT
This project was mainly built using the help of ChatGPT (thanks Chatty!). You can check and work from my chat logs via the following Link: https://chatgpt.com/share/69285fce-d568-8009-aee1-7ad624823907

## Additional helpful Extensions
This extension was used in conjunction with https://github.com/La-Cezanne/InAProDaC-Instagram-Automatic-Profile-Data-Collector to scrape profile information from Instagram profiles from a list of profiles without much need of manual interaction but minimal risk of getting blocked or limited by Instagrams scraping protection. Gathered data needs to handled responsibly to conform to european data privacy standards and GDPR.
